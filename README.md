StratoCyberLab is an offline security cyber range to test your knowledge and capabilities on cybersecurity. It was developed by the [Stratosphere Laboratory](https://www.stratosphereips.org/) with two primary goals:

- To setup local-only security environments for remote students of [Introduction to Security class](https://cybersecurity.bsy.fel.cvut.cz/) to follow weekly classes.
- To allow anyone to run local-only realistic cyber range to practice attacking & defending skills in the form of challenges (_think HackTheBox but local in your computer!_)

## Features

- Local-only. No internet is required after download. No cloud. No tracking. No login. No data collection.
- Many cybersecurity exercises in a form of 'challenges'.
- Predefined environments of networks and services for remote students of [Introduction to Security class](https://cybersecurity.bsy.fel.cvut.cz/)
- The lab runs using docker containers on a shared virtual network(s)
- A container is created for the user to start from. You can install any tool you want without modifying your own host computer.
- A web interface to manage the challenges and play.
- All the challenges can be played from the web interface using the built-in WebSSH terminal.
- AI-assisted. The web interface has a local LLM (using _ollama_) to assist in your hacking. You can change the model used.

## Requirements

### Hardware

Resource consumption depends a lot on the user actions. We do not recommend starting all challenges at once
as this may require a lot compute by generating a lot of network traffic and starting many services.

However, we estimate the minium requirements to be **3GB of disk** space and **2GB of spare RAM**. (Note that downloading the LLM model will require extra 5GB of disk space)

### Software

The only requirement to run StratoCyberLab is to have `docker (v>20.10)` installed.

## How to start

To start the lab do:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stratosphereips/stratocyberlab.git
cd stratocyberlab
docker compose up
```

This uses the already prepared [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file.

After the lab bootstraps, navigate in your browser to [http://127.0.0.1/](http://127.0.0.1/) to access a lab's dashboard.

The dashboard contains:

- Predefined environments for each weekly class of [Introduction to Security class](https://cybersecurity.bsy.fel.cvut.cz/) for remote students
- List of standalone hacking challenges
  - Challenges are divided by difficulty into 3 categories `EASY`, `MEDIUM`, `HARD`
  - Each challenge has multiple tasks.
  - Tasks are solved by finding a flag (usually in a format `BSY{...}`) and submitting the flag in the dashboard.
  - Each challenge must be individually started from the dashboard before playing
- Chat with a local AI assistant using `llama3` model
  - Usage and downloading of the model is optional and can be initiated from the dashboard. By default no model is downloaded.
- Built-in SSH web shell to interact with deployed services in the lab
  _ The SSH connection is made to a `hackerlab` container.
  _ If preferred, you can connect directly using SSH from your terminal to the `hackerlab` container with command
  `ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 2222` and password `ByteThem123`

### Troubleshooting

**Q: I pulled new updates but the lab is running the old version.**

**A:** Depending on the changes, sometimes it's required to force docker to re-build the containers. Please run the lab using a command `docker compose up --build`

**Q: I see _REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION_ warning when trying to SSH into the hackerlab container**

**A:** The ID of hackerlab container is re-generated when the container is recreated. Add `-o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null` option to your SSH command to fix the issue.

## Development

We appreciate all **PRs** with **new challenges** or bug fixes.

Please refer to a separate Development documentation at [./docs/development.md](./docs/development.md).
