Pier 7 Visitor Board – Daily Checklist
--------------------------------------
Morning tide smells like salt and diesel again, but everything is running smoothly:
 - Ferry beacons recalibrated at 06:15, blinking true north.
 - Café freezer defrost cycle finished; remind Nina to restock pastries.
 - Welcome sign still points down the service alley. Fix before tourists wander into the workshop.
 - Maintenance crew owes Luka a thank-you for rewiring the dock lights in the storm.

If you find anything out of place, leave a note in the harbor office log before sundown.
